Background
----------
[Flume](https://flume.apache.org/) is an open-source Apache project, it is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data. This article shows how to import XML Files with Flume, including the development of a deserializer plugin and the corresponding configurations of Flume.
The secenario is that XML files will be sychronized to a directory periodically, we need to config a **Spooling Directory Source** to load these XML files into Flume.

I have used this bot for quite a long while. It is free and safe.
I developed it because I got sick of the infinite farming in Diablo 3. 
This bot is actually an [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script.
It neither reads/writes memory nor performs real-time pixel detections.
It is just a pure Mouse/Keyboard events simulator. So how can it pick up legendary items?
The answer is screenshot scanning. It takes a screenshot after Ghom is down, 
then scans the image and finds out the coordinates of legendary items. Simple but effective.

I also added a feature to upload the icons of the legs that have been picked up to Dropbox dir.
So if you are at work while the bot is running at home, you will see a notification window pop up every fifteen minutes indicates what you've just got.
I was quite exciting to see those notifications at the beginning, but now I have totally lost my interests :(
